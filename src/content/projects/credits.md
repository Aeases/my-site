##### [Not A Number](https://www.nan.fyi/)
From [Nanda Syahrasyad](https://twitter.com/nandafyi)'s [nan.fyi](https://www.nan.fyi/), I really like how alternating left-right title-images break up the posts, and the awesome looking svgs for covers, I cant make svgs look that good yet, but I sure can use Excalidraw!

##### [Flexoki](https://stephango.com/flexoki)
The [Flexoki](https://stephango.com/flexoki) colour pallete from stephango, This is the only dark pallete that manages that 'ink on paper' feeling. It nails not only blacks from their whites, but blacks from greens, blacks from blues and so on.
