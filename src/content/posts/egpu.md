# What is an EGPU?
It's like a **GPU** but it's **E**xternal, which means you can plug it into any laptop and power up its (often shit) GPU power by 10x with a desktop level card.

Integrated Graphics still suck but laptop CPU's are pretty close to the power of desktop CPU's, so instead of plugging your GPU into a tower that you can't move around, you can plug it into a laptop that can come along with you anywhere you go.

Laptops also tend to work better when it comes to wireless stuff, It may be a skill-issue but every desktop I've owned has had weird issues with bluetooth, and sometimes wireless but laptops just don't have these problems. 

I first thought about switching when I bought my new framework laptop, the CPU it had (Ryzen 7640U) had basically identical performance to my then desktop CPU (Ryzen 5600x) while also having 333% lower power consumption.
When I got my framework I stuck my desktop's 2TB M.2 SSD in it and hooked it up to my old 3070 via a thunderbolt cable.

Thunderbolt is pretty epic by the way 

I found out the CPU power of my 4 year old desktop CPU was about the same as my new framework laptop, so I decided to give the desktop away but keep the graphics card, and stick it in a EGPU enclosure
